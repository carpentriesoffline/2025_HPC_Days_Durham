\begin{frame}{Advantages of using a miniHPC}
	\begin{itemize}[label={$\color{UmUBlue}\bullet$}]
		\item How many people ever get to see an HPC?
		\item It makes the hardware less abstract
		\item Real systems are busy doing actual research (85 to 95\% load on systems)
		\item Learners worried about working on a multi-million Â£ system
		\item Instead use low cost components that can easily be replaced - such as Raspberry Pis
		\item Resource limits more apparent
		\item More control over the environment
		\item No need to have accounts on a real HPC
		\item No need for expensive cloud hosting
		\item Own access point, so independent of university networks or the Internet
	\end{itemize}
